Just simple scripts and tools made with different AI models, their prompts and result.

### [Python script to rename files](https://github.com/mmiglioranza22/chatgptools/blob/d2a46514ab56fcee5911750d3b89bf2091905cea/filename_changer/README.md)

This is done in the spirit of the timeless sayings proven right by countless workers in corporate around the world:

_"This meeting could have been an email"_
