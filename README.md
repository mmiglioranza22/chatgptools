I will be adding to this repo some solutions I came up with AI for actual stuff I relinquised from doing manually (Yet instead spent far more in writting accurate prompts than doing the actual task).

Just simple scripts and tools made with different AI models, their prompts and result.

This is done in the spirit of the timeless sayings proven right by countless workers in corporate around the world:

_"This meeting could have been an email"_
<br>
_"This email could have been a Slack message"_
<br>
_"This Slack message could have been an emoji reaction"_

Eventually, a new saying will appear that might replace them all: "_I'll just prompt it_"
